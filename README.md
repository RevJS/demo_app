# RevJS Task Management Demo Application

This is a full-stack JavaScript demo app that shows how you can build a rich
data-driven web application with very minimal code, using RevJS.

## Trying it out

There is a client-side only demo hosted [here](https://revjs.org/tasks_demo).

## Running it locally with the GrapQL API

To install and run the project, run the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/RevJS/demo_app.git revjs_demo
cd revjs_demo
npm i
npm start
```

## To hack on it locally

After installing it as above, run the following commands in two seperate consoles:

```
npm run watch-server
npm run watch-client
```

## TODO

* Enter to search!
* Tasks List on Projects
* Searching Tasks based on User / Project name instead of ID
* Reduce bundle size (material-ui is big!)
